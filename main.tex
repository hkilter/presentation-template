\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
Why a quantitative approach might be used in the decision-making process:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The problem is complex, and the manager cannot develop a good solution without the aid of quantitative analysis.
  \item The problem is especially important (e.g., a great deal of money is involved), and the manager desires a thorough analysis before attempting to make a decision.
  \item The problem is new, and the manager has no previous experience from which to draw.
  \item The problem is repetitive, and the manager saves time and effort by relying on quantitative procedures to make routine decision recommendations.

Office Furnature Shop produces three products: Desk, Chair, Molded steel. In the production facility steel as the raw material is used for producing these products. Managers don't worry about the sale process, all products will be sold. We already know two functions from previous slides;
\begin{itemize}
  \item what the total profit of this shop can be at the end of the day, and
  \item how much raw material should be used (required) for production in that day.
\end{itemize}
Company has a warehouse with the capacity of two thousand kilogram and contains steel in it. On that day, managers decide to satisfy expo's contract commitments which are at least hundred desks and at most five hundred chairs.

\vskip0.5cm%
Delta Hardware Stores is a regional retailer with warehouses in three cities in California:
\begin{itemize}
  \item San Jose,
  \item Fresno, and
  \item Azusa.
\end{itemize}

Each month, Delta restocks its warehouses with its own brand of paint. Delta has its own paint manufacturing plant in Phoenix, Arizona.

Although the plantâs production capacity is sometime inefficient to meet monthly demand, a recent feasibility study commissioned by Delta found that it was not cost effective to expand production capacity at this time.
To meet demand, Delta subcontracts with a national paint manufacturer to produce paint under the Delta label and deliver it (at a higher cost) to any of its three California warehouses.
There is to be no expansion of plant capacity.

\vskip0.5cm%
Three types of manufacturing equipment for engine gaskets are under consideration. Their fixed costs and resulting variable costs per unit are shown in the table below.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.33\textwidth}p{0.33\textwidth}p{0.33\textwidth}}
  \hline
              & \emph{Fixed Cost (\$)} & \emph{Variable Cost (\$/unit)} \\
  \hline
  Equipment A & 4,000  & 1.90 \\
  Equipment B & 7,000  & 1.40\\
  Equipment C & 12,000 & 1.00\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item At what volume of production would Equipment A and Equipment B cost the same?  \item Establish this breakeven point for equipments B and C.  \item Suppose the volume anticipated was 8,000 units. Which equipment should be purchased?  \item Suppose the volume anticipated was 12,900 units. Which equipment should then be purchased?
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Problem -- Break-Even Analysis}
\vskip0.5cm%
Two brothers want to open a small neighborhood bakery, where they will specialize in loaves of bread. They have carefully estimated their fixed costs to be \$110,000 per year. This includes a salary of \$35,000 for each brother.
\vskip0.5cm%
The facility they will use is a former pizza kitchen. One problem is that there is limited capacity, so there will be an upper limit on the number of loaves of bread they can produce.
\vskip0.5cm%
Baking 6 days a week, the brothers believe they can produce 150 loaves per day. The cost to them for each loaf is \$0.55. They believe they will be able to sell all the bread they can bake. They plan to bake 312 days during the year.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Given these projections, how much will the brothers have to charge per loaf to stay in business?
  \item Suppose they are willing to take a much lower salary to get their business started. If they each agreed to take only \$25,000 per year, how much would they have to charge for their bread?
