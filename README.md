# presentation-template
I am using this TeX/LaTeX template to create my lecture presentations.

- XeLaTeX engine for system font usage
- Custom Beamer theme (sty files)
- With figures (/img)
- With custom graphics in Tikz (/img)

**IMPORTANT**  
It contains full of garbage, you need to clear almost all content to get a meaningful structure.
