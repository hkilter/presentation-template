# presentation-template (texsx)
I am using this TeX/LaTeX template to create my lecture presentations.

- XeLaTeX engine for system font usage
- Custom Beamer theme (sty files)
- With figures (/img)
- ~~With custom graphics in Tikz (/img)~~
- Template color RGB (132 50 5)

This template is created based on an answer at https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/147533/51010 by [marczellm](https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/21963/marczellm).

**IMPORTANT**  
It contains full of garbage, you need to clear almost all content to get a meaningful structure.
